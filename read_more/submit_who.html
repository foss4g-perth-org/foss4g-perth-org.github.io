<p>We would love to have a diverse array of speakers, with strong representation across genders, different cultural
    backgrounds, young and old, and urban and rural. We can only do this if we get the submissions, so please, be brave
    and do it!</p>
<p>We're here to help you deliver a great presentation or workshop. If this is new to you, we can connect you with an
    experienced speaker to help prepare your submission, or review and advise on how to produce a slide deck. We're
    happy to brainstorm with you on possible topics, or talk about your idea. Be in touch at
    <a href="mailto:foss4gperth@gmail.com">foss4gperth@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>We encourage submissions from regional Western Australians - this is not only a conference
    for Perth residents, so come and bring your local perspectives.</p>
