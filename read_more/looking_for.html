<p><b>Presentations:</b> submit proposals for full-length talks (15 minutes) or lightning talks (5 minutes).</p>
<p>We want to hear what's happening in open source geospatial, open data, and OpenStreetMap. What are you working on? Do
    you have a success (or failure!) story? Are you part of an interesting open collaboration? Are you developing
    something new that you want to share? Are there tools, tricks or workflows that you can teach? What have you learnt
    from your open community?</p>
<p>We want a variety of content from a diverse array of speakers, so don’t feel that your idea won’t belong. We welcome
    workshop ideas targeting participants with minimal geospatial skills or the experienced. We're open-minded about
    what this looks like, but here are some general themes to get you thinking:</p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Case studies from your organisation or community.</li>
    <li>Use of open source tools & open data, or new tools you're developing. </li>
    <li>Community building projects, collaborations or your perspective on our community.</li>
    <li>Your spectacular successes (or formidable failures).</li>
    <li>Challenges you're facing or that you see the community facing. </li>
    <li>Interesting workflows, or introductions to open geospatial technologies and projects that you can teach.</li>
    <li>Whatever's on your mind! This is your conference...</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Everything geospatial:</b> Think anything ‘geo’ related! From hardcore GIS, cartography, geology, geoscience, and
    remote sensing to historical maps, psychogeography, geocaching, and general mapping nerdery. Any area, project, or
    challenge where knowing the geo context is key!</p>
<p><b>Open source geospatial:</b> think QGIS, PostGIS, Leaflet, OpenLayers, Python, R, GeoServer, MapServer, and the
    usual suspects, but also, think outside that box. What is in development?</p>
<p><b>OpenStreetMap & open data:</b> what are you building, what are you using, and what are the obstacles in obtaining,
    using or opening up your data?</p>
