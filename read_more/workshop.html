<p>In recent years, not one, but two excellent QGIS-based mobile apps for field geospatial data collection have gained a large following: QField and Mergin Maps. Both apps are free & open source and can function entirely offline, with cloud-based utilities for syncing field data to a central location.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we'll:

  <ul>
    <ol>1. walk through the process for setting up a data collection project in QGIS, with offline base maps, the ability to capture photos, and field-friendly data capture forms with dropdown lists, constraints, and real-time data validation</ol>
    <ol>2. get some fresh air, taking our project into the field with a brief walk around Esplanade Park in Fremantle</ol>
    <ol>3. return to our home base, where we'll sync our field data on a cloud platform.</ol>

  </ul>
</p>

<p>Participants are asked to bring a laptop with a recent version of QGIS, and a mobile device with either QField or Mergin Maps installed. We'll get in touch in advance to provide further details.
