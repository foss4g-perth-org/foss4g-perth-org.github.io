<h2>What sort of conference is it?</h2>

<p>The open ethos of the event guides how it is organised, what you can expect to hear and who will be there. FOSS4G
    Perth welcomes all users, contributors, mappers and enthusiasts of geospatial. The event offers a broad mix of
    topics and perspectives, aiming to be accessible to newcomers and energising for experienced geospatial
    practitioners.</p>
<p>For an idea of how the first day of presentations will look, check out last year’s program. The second day of this
    year’s conference has been expanded to include half-day workshops.</p>

<h2>Who will be there?</h2>

<p>At FOSS4G SotM the presenters, workshop leaders, volunteers and participants come from all realms of the open
    geospatial community – academia, business, government, from dabblers to developers. It is the place to meet people
    beyond your usual work or study environment, and build the collaborations and cross-pollination connections that
    open source communities inspire.</p>
<p>You will encounter technical conversation, shared experiences and diverse perspectives on open geospatial journeys.
    Regional and local speakers will connect you to the latest and greatest of global FOSS4G and OpenStreetMap projects.
</p>

<h2>Why should I go?</h2>

<p>You’ll be inspired, you’ll hear about all the fun toys, you’ll meet new friends and future colleagues! There will be
    many opportunities to share your geospatial news alongside the speakers, within workshops and over a beverage. It’s
    a friendly environment in which to air your ideas with a like-minded community, ask those silly questions and pick
    up technical tips that can make all the difference!</p>
