Submit your presentation and workshop proposals now! We’re calling for:

- full-length talks (15 minutes)
- lightning talks (5 minutes)
- half-day workshops.

We're inviting the Western Australian open geospatial and mapping community to get involved by submitting a proposal. Gather up your stories, hits and misses and share with us - we’re dying to hear what you’ve been working on! There are opportunities for first-time speakers, workshop leaders, experienced FOSS4G practitioners and curious newcomers. 

If you don’t live in Perth and may struggle to cover travel costs, keep in touch to hear about availability of travel grants and application details. We will post updates when we have more information. 

## How to submit a proposal?

Please apply via this form (before 5 October) and be ready to provide the following information:

- What type of presentation or workshop are you proposing?
- What is the title of your presentation/workshop?
- Give a concise description of your proposed presentation/workshop in 250 words or less.
- Let us know if you have any specific requirements for delivering your presentation/workshop.

Submissions must be received no later than 11:59 PM (AWST), 5 October 2021.
