FOSS4G Perth is a full day event dedicated to the exploration, promotion, and exchange of ideas around Free and Open Source for Geospatial (FOSS4G). This year, we are excited to collaborate with the ISPRS Technical Commission IV Symposium, bringing people together to create connections among attendees and experts from the global ISPRS community.

We'd like to invite you to take this opportunity to become a financial sponsor for the FOSS4G Perth conference in Fremantle, WA in 2024. As a sponsor, you'll receive prominent exposure, allowing you to demonstrate your company's work and values. In additional, you'll be extending your support to the whole open source geospatial community.
