FOSS4G Perth is a full day event dedicated to the exploration, promotion, and exchange of ideas around Free and Open Source for Geospatial (FOSS4G). This year, we are excited to collaborate with the ISPRS Technical Commission IV Symposium, bringing people together to create connections among attendees and experts from the global ISPRS community.

We'd like to invite you to take this opportunity to sponsor FOSS4G Perth 2024. As a sponsor, you'll receive prominent exposure, allowing you to demonstrate your company's work and values. In addition, you'll be extending your support to the whole open source geospatial community.

**We'll release a sponsorship prospectus very soon. In the meantime, for more information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@foss4g-perth.org">admin@foss4g-perth.org</a>.**
