## Become a sponsor

We're pleased to share the opportunity to become a sponsor of FOSS4G Perth 2024! 

FOSS4G Perth is a community-driven event for the Western Australian open geospatial community, dedicated to the exploration, promotion, and exchange of ideas around Free and Open Source for Geospatial (FOSS4G). FOSS4G events are part of a community-focused global movement, supported by OSGeo, with the objective of fostering and promoting the adoption of open source geospatial technology.

This year, we're partnering with the ISPRS Technical Commission IV Symposium, a major international academic conference focused on advancing spatial information science, enabling spatial digital twins and empowering the metaverse.

### What's planned?
* A 1-day FOSS4G "mini-conference" open geospatial event featuring keynote addresses, full-length presentations, and lightning talks from our local open geospatial community
* An evening social hosted by FOSS4G Perth for FOSS4G attendees and ISPRS delegates
* Reciprocal access to events - ISPRS delegates can attend FOSS4G Perth, and vice versa

  <h3>Why sponsor?</h3>
    <div>
        Sponsoring FOSS4G Perth aligns your brand with a positive, community-focused initiative and enhances visibility among local and international delegates. It offers access to potential future hires, opportunities to network and build relationships, and supports the free and open-source software community, with the added bonus of generating warm, fuzzy feelings from knowing you are making a positive difference.
