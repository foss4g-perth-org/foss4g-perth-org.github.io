        <p>FOSS4G Perth is a community-driven event for the Western Australian open geospatial community, focused on sharing stories and having fun with "Free and Open Source Software For Geospatial". Whether you're a seasoned open geospatial enthusiast, a recent convert, a casual user, or simply curious, we'd love to see you there!</p>
        <p>Join us for another exciting event to swap stories and share ideas on our favourite open source tools, including QGIS, PostGIS, OpenStreetMap, Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, Python-based earth observation libraries and frameworks, GDAL, and many others. We aim to promote collaboration, innovation, and the exchange of ideas within the open source geospatial community.</p>
