We believe that a healthy and diverse open geospatial community includes people from all kinds of backgrounds, regardless of your ability to pay. To help make sure the cost of attending this event isn't an obstacle, we're running a grant program, with free registrations and modest financial support available.

We especially want to help people from underrepresented parts of the community, such as:

- women and minority genders
- Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities
- students or community development workers who don’t have workplace or government funding
- anyone with an interest in open geospatial, who would find it difficult to attend without support

We’ll be accepting applications right up until the day before the conference, or until the allocation is exhausted. Applications will be assessed as they are submitted.

**The application for free registration will go live shortly, so keep checking back here or keep an eye on our social media channels.**
