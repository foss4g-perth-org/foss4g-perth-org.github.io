We believe that a healthy and diverse open geospatial community includes people of all backgrounds, regardless of their economic or personal situation. To help make sure that all individuals have an equal opportunity to attend the Perth FOSS4G conference, we are running a grant program, providing modest financial support on a first-come, first-serve basis. 

We especially want to help people from underrepresented parts of the community, such as:

- women and minority genders
- Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities
- students or community development workers who don’t have workplace or government funding
- anyone with an interest in open geospatial, who would find it difficult to attend without support

We’ll be accepting applications right up until the day before the conference, or until the allocation is exhausted. Applications will be assessed as they are submitted.

### Submit a Grant Application

We understand it can be difficult to attend a conference and related events. If there is a way we can help you to attend, through financial support or otherwise, please ask.  

We do not have unlimited funds so some applications may not be funded, but we will do our best to help everyone we can. Please fill in the form below and we will do our best to help with your request.

<!-- **The application for free registration will go live shortly, so keep checking back here or keep an eye on our social media channels.** -->
