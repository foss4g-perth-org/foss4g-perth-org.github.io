## Call for Presentations

We're inviting the Western Australian open geospatial and mapping community to get involved by submitting a presentation. Gather up your stories, hits and misses, and share with us - we’re dying to hear what you’ve been working on! There are opportunities for first-time speakers, experienced FOSS4G practitioners and curious newcomers.

## Workshop: 22 October 2024 (am)

### Collecting data in the field with free & open source geospatial tools: QGIS, QField, and Mergin Maps


In recent years, not one, but two excellent QGIS-based mobile apps for field geospatial data collection have gained a large following: QField and Mergin Maps. Both apps are free & open source and can function entirely offline, with cloud-based utilities for syncing field data to a central location.

In this tutorial, we'll:

1. walk through the process for setting up a data collection project in QGIS, with offline base maps, the ability to capture photos, and field-friendly data capture forms with dropdown lists, constraints, and real-time data validation
2. get some fresh air, taking our project into the field with a brief walk around Esplanade Park in Fremantle
3. return to our home base, where we'll sync our field data on a cloud platform

Participants are asked to bring a laptop with a recent version of QGIS, and a mobile device with either QField or Mergin Maps installed. We'll get in touch in advance to provide further details.



**Presenters**: John Bryant, Grant Boxer, John Duncan

**Duration**: 2.5h
