## Call for Presentations

We're inviting the Western Australian open geospatial and mapping community to get involved by submitting a presentation. Gather up your stories, hits and misses, and share with us - we’re dying to hear what you’ve been working on! There are opportunities for first-time speakers, experienced FOSS4G practitioners and curious newcomers.

**Stay tuned! Our Call for Presentations opens on 1 July.**
