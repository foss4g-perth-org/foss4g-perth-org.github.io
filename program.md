<h4>Karen Joyce</h4>

<a href="https://www.isprs.org/tc4-symposium2024/speakers.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">A biographer for Mother Earth, using satellites and drones as my scientific illustrators.</a> I share my experiences drawn from 25 years as a geospatial scientist in academia, military, industry, and small business to help people discover science beyond lab coats and test tubes. But I have an ulterior motive. I am passionate about how we can use drones and geospatial technology to watch over our environment and its changes. So the more people I can inspire to join me, the faster we can put plans in place to help keep our environment healthy into the future.

<h4>Andrew Dowding</h4>
<p>
Andrew’s role is to manage and guide Winyama, create opportunities for the team to grow into their roles and most importantly to generate work for the organisation to be sustainable. Andrew is from the Ngarluma traditional owner group and grew up between Perth, Sydney, and the Pilbara.

Andrew’s passion is Indigenous mapping and the use of technology for cultural safeguarding. He co-founded Winyama in 2018 to provide more opportunity for Indigenous people to work in the geospatial industry and within the broader digital economy.

## Workshop: 22 October 2024 (am)

### Collecting data in the field with free & open source geospatial tools: QGIS, QField, and Mergin Maps


In recent years, not one, but two excellent QGIS-based mobile apps for field geospatial data collection have gained a large following: QField and Mergin Maps. Both apps are free & open source and can function entirely offline, with cloud-based utilities for syncing field data to a central location.

In this tutorial, we'll:

1. walk through the process for setting up a data collection project in QGIS, with offline base maps, the ability to capture photos, and field-friendly data capture forms with dropdown lists, constraints, and real-time data validation
2. get some fresh air, taking our project into the field with a brief walk around Esplanade Park in Fremantle
3. return to our home base, where we'll sync our field data on a cloud platform

Participants are asked to bring a laptop with a recent version of QGIS, and a mobile device with either QField or Mergin Maps installed. We'll get in touch in advance to provide further details.



**Presenters**: John Bryant, Grant Boxer, John Duncan

**Duration**: 2.5h
